1. What technique did you use for watching the data and clock lines (polling or interrupts)? Why did you choose that?

I used interrupts with buffering. I chose to do this so that I can use this code for more interesting things in the
future.

2. Did you use the oscilloscopes in the class room to help debug your lab setup?

No I didn't need to.

3. What difficulties did you have keeping track of when to sample the data line?

I didn't have any difficulties because I used interrupts on the negative clock edge.

4. What did you try that didn't work?

I didn't have any problems.

5. If you have problems integrating the LED display library you can exclude that IF YOU 
NEED TO. Describe the problems you had and what you tried to do to fix things. Make 
sure you include stubs for the LED library so the CLI will continue to work (just not 
display scrolling messages).

My LED library worked fine.
